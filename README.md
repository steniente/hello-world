# hello-world
My first git respository !

I made my first commit to my first branch of "readme-edits" which is different from the master.

I just completed stepes 1-5

Step 1. Create a Repository

Step 2. Create a Branch

Step 3. Make and commit changes

Step 4. Open a Pull Request

Step 5. Merge your Pull Request

And created a new branch: Readme-edits 2 
I will intentionally leave a tYpe-o so I can later open a pull request and correct it.
